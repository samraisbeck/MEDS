# MEDS
Medicine Examination and Daily Sorting (MEDS)

## Description
MEDS is a program that controlled a robot to deliver the correct type and amount of
pills to the corresponding day of the week in a weekly pill divider. It was made for a
first-year design project in late 2015.

Perhaps the logic could be implemented for another project in the future, but the
syntax is fairly specific for this project. It worked well and got the job done.

The way it works is you would load your pills into the compartment of the robot, then it would
check the color of the pill, and based on that, it would deposit it into the correct
section of the pill divider.
